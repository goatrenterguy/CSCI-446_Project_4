## Reinforcement Learning and the Racetrack Problem
For the fourth programming assignment, you will implement a reinforcement learner and apply it to the racetrack problem. The racetrack problem is a standard control problem that will serve to illustrate several interesting properties of reinforcement learning algorithms.
The racetrack problem is a standard control problem. The goal is to control the movement of a race car along a pre-defined racetrack. You want your race car to get from the starting line to the finish line in a minimum amount of time. In this version of the problem, your agent will be the only racer on the track, so it is more like a time trial than a full competitive race.
